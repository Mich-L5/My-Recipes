## Features

### Categorization
Recipes are categorized by type of dish (app, main, side, dessert, drink or sauce). When a new recipe is added, it gets added to its respective category page, and can easily be retrieved by accessing its category tab.

### Formatting (ingredients and directions)
When separated by semicolons, recipe ingredients automatically get formatted in a bullet point list, as well as recipe directions automatically get formatted in a numbered list.

### Recipe sorting
In addition to recipe categorization, recipes can be further sorted by alphabetical order, total time, and rating score, by clicking on the respective column heading.

### Desktop, tablet, and mobile responsive
The app is responsive across all three platforms (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

### Recipe total time calculation
The recipe total time is automatically calculated based on its prep time and cook time. The total time gets displayed in the recipe list, and can be used as a sorting parameter.
